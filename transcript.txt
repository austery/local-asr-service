What do you think about cloud code in comparison to OpenCL? So cloud code and maybe the Codex coding agent. Do you see them as kind of competitors? I mean, first of all, competitors are fun when it's not really a competition. Yeah. Like, I'm happy if if if all it did is like inspire people to build something new. Cool. Um, I still use Codex for the building. I I know a lot of people use OpenCL to to build stuff, and I worked hard on it to make that work. And I do smaller stuff with it in terms of code, but like if I work hours and hours, I want a big screen, not WhatsApp. You know, so for me, the person agent is much more about my life, or like, like a coworker. Like I give it like a GitHub. Like Hey, try out the CCL. Does it actually work?
